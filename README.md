## Setup
This application is intended to run on the OSMC Raspberry Pi operating system. Why OSMC over Raspbian? OSMC is much more light-weight out of the box and provides a more stable Bluetooth protocol stack than Raspbian. During our tests, we found that streaming audio to a Raspbian operating system over Bluetooth can cause long-term instability with playback. OSMC had minimal issues while streaming.
